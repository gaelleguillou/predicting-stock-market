# Predicting the S&amp;P500 index
A short and simple python program using sci-kit learn with data from the S&amp;P500 index. It is a guided project from the DataQuest course (answers not provided).
I used a linear regression model based on basic indicators : last 5 days price average, last 365 days price average, last 365 days price standard deviation.
